🌾✨ Smart Crop Disease Detection & Automated Action System

A modern AI + IoT farming solution designed to detect crop leaf diseases in real time and automatically activate the required action. This project uses a CNN deep learning model with ESP32-based hardware automation to support farmers with fast, accurate, and smart plant health monitoring.

🚀 What This System Can Do

✔ Detect crop diseases from leaf images (Wilt, Blight, Rust)
✔ Automatically turn ON sprayers/pumps using relays
✔ Monitor temperature, humidity & soil moisture live
✔ Show data on a mini OLED display
✔ Send instant alerts to mobile via Blynk/Telegram
✔ Reduce manual monitoring & prevent crop loss
