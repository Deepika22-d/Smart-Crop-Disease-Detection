🌱🤖 Smart Crop Disease Detection and Action System

A powerful AI + IoT-based system designed to identify crop leaf diseases in real-time and automatically activate pumps or sprayers to protect crops. This project helps farmers monitor plants easily, reduce crop losses, and improve productivity through smart technology.

🎯 Objective

To detect crop diseases early using image processing and a CNN model, and to perform automatic disease control actions using ESP32-controlled relays and pumps.
